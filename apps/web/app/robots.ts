// noindex is never read. So /explore, /r/ and /lp/ are crawlable for `*` and carry noindex, and
// /lp/ in particular must stay crawlable because Google's AdsBot has to reach the ad landings.
//
// AI crawlers are the other way round: several of them do not honour a meta noindex, so the
// zones that must stay out of answers (gallery, model pages, hub, ad landings, auth) are
// disallowed for them outright. A group for a named agent replaces the `*` group for that agent,
// so it repeats the app and API prefixes.
