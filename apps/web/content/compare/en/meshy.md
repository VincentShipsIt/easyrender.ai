If you want a Meshy alternative for real products, easyrender turns one photo into a 3D model by way of a free nine-view angle sheet, and charges per model only when you build it. Meshy covers more ground: text-to-3D, up to four input images, texturing, rigging and animation, with monthly credit plans. Pick by what you start from.

## How do Meshy and easyrender compare?

Both are AI image-to-3D tools. They differ in what goes in, how you pay and what comes out. Prices are as listed in November 2026.

## How does Meshy work?

Meshy has three ways in. Image to 3D takes one JPG, PNG or WebP of up to 20 MB. Multi Image to 3D takes one to four images, which its docs say "should show the same object from different angles", with the first used as the front.

Text to 3D works in two steps. A preview step makes an untextured mesh from a prompt of up to 800 characters, and a refine step textures it.

The settings go deeper than most tools. You can ask for PBR maps (metallic, roughness and normal) on top of the base colour, base colour textures at 2K, 4K or 8K, and quad or triangle faces when remeshing. A target face count runs from 100 to 300,000, with 30,000 as the default.

On its API pricing page, an image-to-3D model with 2K textures on its current models costs 30 credits. Rigging costs 5 credits and animation 3 credits per action. Paid plans state a "Private & Customer owned" licence and unlimited downloads.

## How does easyrender work?

easyrender has one way in: a photo of a real product, such as a supplier shot of an oak side chair. You can add a short note for what the photo hides, like "open back" or "four drawers".

1. Upload the photo. It is checked for size, proportions and blur.
2. Check the angle sheet. Nine views are drawn from your photo: eight round the object in 45-degree steps, one from above. It is free.
3. Count the parts in every view: legs, doors, handles. If something is off, change the photo or the note.
4. Build the model only if it looks right. That is when you spend {{renderCredits}} credits.
5. Download the GLB for the web and Android, and the USDZ for Apple devices.

If a build fails, the credits for it go back to your balance. AR is coming soon, so you will be able to see the piece in your room from your phone. [Upload a photo](/) to try the first two steps for free.

## What do you need the model for?

Decide that first, because it picks the tool for you. Each goal below comes with a check you can run on either tool's output.

- A model of a product you sell, for a product page. Count legs, doors and handles against the real piece, and turn the model to the back, the side the photo never showed.
- A game or animation asset. Check that the file opens in your engine and that a rig moves the right parts. Meshy's FBX export, rigging and animation are made for this.
- A concept that does not exist yet. A text prompt is the input. Judge it on whether it matches the brief, not on accuracy.
- A predictable bill. Work out the cost per finished model on each tool's pricing page, counting the previews and retries you threw away.

## What goes wrong with AI image-to-3D, and how do you fix it?

These failures show up in every image-to-3D tool, because they come from the photo or the setup. This is the list we check.

| Symptom                                    | Cause                                                    | Fix                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The photo only shows the front             | The camera did not see the back or the sides             | Use a three-quarter photo; in Meshy add a back view as a second image, in easyrender write "open back" in the note |
| Two chair legs merge into one              | From the front, the back legs hide behind the front ones | Shoot from three-quarters so all four legs stand apart                                                             |
| Part of the rug becomes part of the table  | A busy background                                        | Crop tight, or shoot against a plain wall                                                                          |
| A pale outline round the edges             | A cut-out with a halo from the background remover        | Check the edge at full size before you upload                                                                      |
| A text-to-3D chair is not your chair       | Text invents a product                                   | Use image input for anything you sell                                                                              |
| The file will not open in your game engine | Wrong format for the tool                                | Use FBX or OBJ from Meshy; use GLB for the web and USDZ for Apple AR                                               |
| Credits are gone before month end          | Plan credits reset monthly and do not carry over         | Size the plan to what you build, or use credits that do not expire                                                 |

## Who should pick Meshy, and who should pick easyrender?

Pick Meshy if you make game assets, characters or concepts from text. Its rigging, animation, retexturing and FBX export cover work we do not do. It also suits you if you have up to four photos of the object and want to use them all.

Pick easyrender if you sell furniture, decor or another physical product and have one photo of it. The free angle sheet lets you judge the shape before you pay, and you buy credits per model without a monthly reset.

The fairest test is your own photo through both tools. Judge the back, the part counts and the texture at full screen, then the cost per model you keep. The checks are in [how to make a 3D model](/learn/how-to-make-a-3d-model).

## FAQ

### Is easyrender a free Meshy alternative?

The preview is free: you see the object from nine angles without a credit card. A finished model costs {{renderCredits}} credits, which is {{renderPrice}}. Meshy has a free plan with 100 credits a month and outputs under a CC BY 4.0 licence, which allows commercial use with attribution.

### Does easyrender do text-to-3D like Meshy?

No, easyrender starts from a photo of a real object. Meshy's Text to 3D makes a mesh from a prompt of up to 800 characters and textures it in a second step. If the product does not exist yet, Meshy is the one to use. If you have a photo of it, both can work from that.

### Which file formats does each tool export?

easyrender gives you a GLB, for the web and most 3D tools, and a USDZ, for Apple devices. Meshy lists FBX, OBJ, USDZ, GLB and BLEND among its downloads. If your next step is Unity, Unreal or a rig, Meshy's FBX is the practical choice.

### Are my models private?

On easyrender, finished models appear in the public gallery by default, and you can switch "Show in public gallery" off on the model's page. Meshy's paid plans state a private, customer-owned licence, while free plan outputs are under CC BY 4.0.
