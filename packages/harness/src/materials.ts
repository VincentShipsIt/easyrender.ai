// Material profiles: what a material can physically do, written as visual instructions for the
// sheet model. A 3D model that a professional can start from has to look makeable: stone is cut
// and carved, never bent; tube bends in smooth arcs; solid wood follows its grain. Each profile
// is matched against the product name and the user's note and adds a short rule block to the
// sheet prompt. The figures and their sources are in .agents/memory/context/materials-*.md.
// Plain data, like the skills, so a profile is a few lines to add or tune.

Curves are shallow or carved from a thick block (pedestals, rounded edges), and thin curved ribbons, hairline legs and long unsupported overhangs are not credible: tops sit on legs, pedestals or a base. Keep one continuous vein pattern through the solid, with the polish or honed finish shown in the photo.',
